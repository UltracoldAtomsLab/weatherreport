# WeatherStation

Relevant to the [WeatherStation][1] in our laboratory, this is a
collection of scripts that uses the data generated by our weather
logging hardware.

## Emailing data log

Pull a fixed interval's data (eg. 24h) and email it out. The shell script
is to be called by cron.

## Comparison
